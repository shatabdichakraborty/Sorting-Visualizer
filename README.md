# Sorting-Visualizer
This is a sorting algorithm visualizer web application designed to understand the different sorting techniques like heap sort,quick sort,merge sort,selection sort,insertion sort and bubble sort with the help of live visualisation inspired by Clement. Theres also an control to change the size of the array and the speed of the algorithm. Also i used scss for the first time and this made my life much easier.
